what options we have for server side programming
->JAVA SE API(Core java) - to develop standalone app - we do have applets but it is worked at the browser side - 
->Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts
		program that help web servers generate dynamic webpages
		not feesible, since this create new process for every new request - pull down the perfomence of the app
		traditional way
->other platforms for server side programming ASP.NET, NODE.JS, PHP
-WE ARE USING JAVA EE SERVELETS
======================================================================
FEATURES OF SERVELETS
--------------------
ROBUST SEREVR SIDE PROGRAMMING TO GENERATE DYNAMIC WEB CONTENT
EFIICIENT AS OPPOSED TO CGI SCRIPTS - creates a thread for every new request(used multithreding concept)
work along with all jvm features, platforms indipendence, object oriented, multithreading, garbege collection
serevlet specification JSR315: java servelt 3.0 in java EE6, JAVA SE 6
JSR 340: JAVA SERVELET 3.1 IN JAVA 7
